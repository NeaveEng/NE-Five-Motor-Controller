NE-Five Motor Driver

This is the PCB that controls the wheels and linear actuator on NE-Five, it's a work in progress and used entirely at your own risk. 

Highlights
==

It uses a Pi Pico at its core with four IFX9201SG motor controllers, it has one servo header that includes an analogue feedback pin to control a linear actuator.


Thanks!
